# Variables
1. Local Variables: seen only inside the method. They should be declared and initiated before the first use.
2. Instance Variables (Non-static Variables): depend on instace of object to be seen. It is recommended to make these variables private. Default values: for numbers the default value is 0, for Booleans it is false and for object references it is null.
3. Classes Variables (Static Variables): accessed by class. If a static attribute receives new value, this value will be reflected to all instances of the class.

```java
public class VariablesExample
{

public String instanceVariable = variable0;
public static String classVariable = variable1;

    public void LocalVariable()
    {
        String localVariable = variable2;
    }
} 

///Another class
public class Example2
{
    public static void main( String[] args ) {
       VariablesExample.classVariable; //how to access static variable from another class 
    }
}
```

# Classes/ Methods Modifiers

## Access Modifiers
1. Default: accessible by classes in the same package. If none access level is specified, it will be the default.
2. Public: accessible by any other class in any package.
3. Protected: accessible in the same package andÂ subclasses.
4. Private: accessible within the declared class.
    
## Non-access Modifiers
1. final (class): prevents the class from being subclassed.
2. final (method): the content of the method should not be changed by any outsider.
3. abstract: can be accessed using the class name followed by a dot and the name of the variable or method.

# Constructor

* It has the same name as the class.
* One class can have N constructors.
* Java automatically provides a default constructor.

###### Notes
* Classes will always have DEFAULT or PUBLIC access modifiers.
* Interfaces will always have PUBLIC access modifier (also methods/artifacts).

# Data Types

1. Primitive Type: bite, int, char, boolean, short, long, float and double.
2. Object Type: class objects and various types of array variables come under reference datatype.

# Operators

## Arithmetic 
* Addition: +
* Subtraction: -
* Multiplication: *
* Division: /
* Modulus: % (returns remainder)
* Increment: ++
* Decrement: --

## Relational 
* Equal to: ==
* Not equal to: !=
* Greater than: >
* Less than: <
* Greater than or equal: >=
* Less than or equal: <=

## Logical 
* AND: &&
* OR: ||
* NOT: !

## Other Operators

* Conditional Operator (Ternary)

Syntax: variable x = (expression) ? value if true : value if false

Example: b = (a == 1) ? 20: 30;

![](/images/operatorsPrecedence.jpg)

Pre-Increment: First the value is incremented by one and then the value is assigned to the variable.

Post-Increment: First the value is assigned to the variable and then incremented by one.

# Loops

## While: tests the condition before executing the loop body.

```java
while(Boolean_expression) {
   // Statements
}
```

![](/images/while.jpg)

## For: useful when you know how many times a task is to be repeated

```java
for(initialization; Boolean_expression; update) {
   // Statements
}
```

![](/images/for_loop.jpg)


## Do-While: guaranteed to execute at least one time.

```java
do {
   // Statements
}while(Boolean_expression);
```
![](/images/do-while.jpg)

* Continue 

In a for loop, the continue keyword causes control to immediately jump to the update statement.

In a while loop or do/while loop, control immediately jumps to the Boolean expression.

```java
Live Demo
public class Test {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

      for(int x : numbers ) {
         if( x == 30 ) {
            continue;
         }
         System.out.print( x );
         System.out.print("\n");
      }
   }
}
/*
Prints: 
10
20
40
50
/*
```
* Break

When the break statement is encountered inside a loop, the loop is immediately terminated and the program control resumes at the next statement following the loop.

```java
public class Test {

   public static void main(String args[]) {
      int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

      for(int x : numbers ) {
         if( x == 30 ) {
            break;
         }
         System.out.print( x );
         System.out.print("\n");
      }
   }
}
/*
Prints:
10
20
*/
```

* Enhanced for loop 

This is mainly used to traverse collection of elements including arrays.

Syntax: 
```java
for(declaration : expression) {
   // Statements
}
```

* Declaration is the type compatible with the elements of the array you are accessing.
* Expression can be an array variable or method call that returns an array.
```java
Live Demo
public class Test {
   public static void main(String args[]) {
   
      int [] numbers = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};

      for(int x : numbers ) {
         System.out.print( x );
         System.out.print(",");
      }
      System.out.print("\n");
      String [] names = {"James", "Larry", "Tom", "Lacy"};

      for( String name : names ) {
         System.out.print( name );
         System.out.print(",");
      }
   }
}
/*
Output:
10,20,30,40,50

James, Larry, Tom, Lacy
*/
```
# Decision Making
## If
If the Boolean expression evaluates to true then the block of code inside the if statement will be executed. 
```java
int x = 10;

      if( x < 20 ) {
         System.out.print("This is if statement");
      }
//prints out: This is if statement
```
## If Else
If statement can be followed by an optional else statement, which executes when the Boolean expression is false.
```java
int x = 30;

      if( x < 20 ) {
         System.out.print("This is if statement");
      }else {
         System.out.print("This is else statement");
      }
   }
prints out: This is else statement
```
## If...else if...else
Very useful to test various conditions. Keep in mind:
* An if can have zero or one else's and it must come after any else if's.
* An if can have zero to many else if's and they must come before the else.
* Once an else if succeeds, none of the remaining else if's or else's will be tested.
```java
int x = 30;

      if( x == 10 ) {
         System.out.print("Value of X is 10");
      }else if( x == 20 ) {
         System.out.print("Value of X is 20");
      }else if( x == 30 ) {
         System.out.print("Value of X is 30");
      }else {
         System.out.print("This is else statement");
      }
   }
prints out: Value of X is 30
```
## Nested If
You can use one if or else if statement inside another if or else if statement.
```java
int x = 30;
int y = 10;

      if( x == 30 ) {
         if( y == 10 ) {
            System.out.print("X = 30 and Y = 10");
         }
      }
prints out: X = 30 and Y = 10
```
## Switch
Allows a variable to be tested for equality against a list of values (cases).

* The variable used can only be integers, convertable integers (byte, short, char), strings and enums.
* You can have any number of case statements.
* The value for a case must be the same data type as the variable and it must be a constant or a literal.
* When the variable being switched on is equal to a case, the statements following that case will execute until a break statement is reached.
* When a break statement is reached the flow jumps to the next line following the switch statement.
* If no break appears, the flow will fall through to subsequent cases until a break is reached.
* Optional default case must appear at the end of the switch. Used for when none of the cases is true. No break is needed in the default case.
```java
char grade = 'C';

      switch(grade) {
         case 'A' :
            System.out.println("Excellent!"); 
            break;
         case 'B' :
         case 'C' :
            System.out.println("Well done");
            break;
         case 'D' :
            System.out.println("You passed");
         case 'F' :
            System.out.println("Better try again");
            break;
         default :
            System.out.println("Invalid grade");
      }
      System.out.println("Your grade is " + grade);
   }

prints out: 
Well done
Your grade is " + grade
```
# Wrappers
## Boxing
Converting primitive data types into object.
```java
Integer x = 5; 
```
## Unboxing
Wrapper object being converted back to a primitive data type.
```java
x =  x + 10;
```
# Strings - Escapes
* \t : Inserts a tab
* \b : Inserts a backspace
* \n : Inserts a new line
* \r : Inserts a carriage return
* \f : Inserts a form feed
* \' : Inserts a single quote
* \" : Inserts a double quote
* \\ : Inserts a backslash
# Arrays
## Declaration
```java
//Example 1
dataType[] arrayRefVar = new dataType[arraySize];

//Example 2
dataType[] arrayRefVar = {value1, value2, value3};
```
## Iteration
For loop or foreach loop is used because all of the elements in an array have the same type and the size of the array is known.
```java
double[] myList = {1.9, 2.9, 3.4, 3.5};

      // Print all elements using for
      for (int i = 0; i < myList.length; i++) {
         System.out.println(myList[i] + " ");
      }
      // Print all elements using enhanced for
      for (double element: myList) {
         System.out.println(element);
```
# Methods
Syntax:
```java
modifier returnType nameOfMethod (Parameters List) {
   // method body
}
```
## Overloading
When a class has two or more methods by the same name but different parameters, it is known as method overloading.

## This keyword
Used as a reference to the object of the current class. Used to:
* Differentiate the instance variables from local variables if they have same names.
```java
class Student {
   int age;   
   Student(int age) {
      this.age = age;	
   }
}
```
* Call one type of constructor (parametrized constructor or default) from other in a class. 
```java
class Student {
   int age
   Student() {
      this(20);
   }
   
   Student(int age) {
      this.age = age;	
   }
}
```
