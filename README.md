1. Variables
* Local Variables: seen only inside the method.
* Instance Variables (Non-static Variables): depend on instace of object to be seen. 
* Classes Variables (Static Variables): accessed by class

```java
public class VariablesExample
{

public String instanceVariable = variable0;
public static String classVariable = variable1;

    public void LocalVariable()
    {
        String localVariable = variable2;
    }
} 
```

2. Classes/Methods Modifiers

Access Modifiers
* default: accessible by classes in the same package.
* public: accessible by any other class in any package.
* protected: accessible in the same package andÂ subclasses.
* private: accessible within the declared class.
    
Non-access Modifiers
* final (class): prevents the class from being subclassed.
* final (method): the content of the method should not be changed by any outsider
* abstract: can be accessed using the class name followed by a dot and the name of the variable or method.
